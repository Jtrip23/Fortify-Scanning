Fortify Scanning
The image includes the Fortify source code analyzer because the analyzer needs to have the version of .NET available that your source code uses.
The scan utilities are in /etc/fortify/bin if you want to call them directly, or you can use the convenient scan-and-report script:

# Go to your code.
cd ~/dev/my-app

# Create a folder to hold the reports/logs.
mkdir artifacts

# Mount your code at /app and tell the scan to run and publish. If you omit
# the -Publish parameter, the scan will run without publishing. If you
# specify -Verbose, you can get detailed console output.
docker run -i --rm -v ${PWD}:/app `
    fmk.nexus.onefiserv.net/fmk/dotnet/dotnet-8.0-build:FMK-20250401T173337Z `
    Start-FortifyScan.ps1 `
        -BuildId "your-build-id" `
        -Source /app `
        -Application "APMXXXXX" `
        -Version "1.0" `
        -Token "your-token-goes-here" `
        -Email "your.email@fiserv.com" `
        -OutputFolder /app/artifacts `
        -Publish

# Or, as noted, you can run the Fortify commands yourself.
docker run -i --rm -v ${PWD}:/app `
    fmk.nexus.onefiserv.net/fmk/dotnet/dotnet-8.0-build:FMK-20250401T173337Z `
    sourceanalyzer -b APMXXXXX /app


If you use the script, you can control exclusions by adding a .fortify.json file in your source directory. That file looks like this:

{
  "exclude_patterns": [
    "test"
  ]
}


Each of the exclude_patterns will get excluded from the scan.
The output folder will contain:

The logs from the scan, so you can troubleshoot any issues.
The scan results in .txt and .fpr formats.


Create GitLab pipeline for .NET image to perform fortify scan.

This pipeline will primarly scan the .NET code base for the project details provided below.

Background Info:

Talked with the SCA team and as best I can tell there is a way to setup the build and scan using a GitLab Pipeline.

Here is the repository for the Self-Service Portal:

Here is the details given by the SCA team.
